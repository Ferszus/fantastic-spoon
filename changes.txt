Wrong .csv file name (dataa.cvs should be data.cvs)
For loop in importedLines.Count changed to iterate to importedLines.Count-1
streamreader changed to DataReader class from void
Blank lines, and lines that do not have enough data from cvs file are ignored
If not null checks were added to "//clear and correct imported data"
if (table.ParentType != null) check added to "//print all database's tables" and "//print all table's columns"
Added new keyword to Name in ImportedObject class
